### To Run
```
yarn install
yarn dev

### Usage
To test that the extension is producing the correct signature, open the console and click the "Verify Signature" button. If the console logs "Extension Verified", the signature has been verified. If the console logs "Extension failed to verify", the signature failed to verify.
It also logs the results of CryptolibKeyManager verification as a control.
